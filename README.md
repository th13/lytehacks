# The Temple of LyteHacks
### The Secret Temple for Communication with the Backend of LyteHacks

---
Here lie the sacred _**Temple of Lyte**_, to the God of LyteHacks, **Nòde**.

It is rumored that deep within this temple lurks a giant, fire-breathing dragon
known only as **Hápi the Dragon**. It is said that this dragon speaks only in *JSÖN* & *Http*,
two ancient languages, used in conjunction, from the civilization of **Rëst**. Many locals
warn of the dangers of trying to talk to it in any other tongue... "The consequences...
would be dire," say they.

The God of LyteHacks, **Nòde**, accepts offerings from those who dare visit his temple. These
offerings are fed to **Hápi the Dragon**, who, if *hapi* with the offering, will allow you
a single prayer to **Nòde**. **Hàpi the Dragon** is rumored to be thoroughly pleased with
the following offerings:

* A **GET** request for `/registrations`
  * Hàpi is said to have a special affinity for registrations, and is so pleased
  with receiving this offering that he will return to you all of the registrations
  that he knows of.
* In *JSÖN*, communicated through a **POST** request to `/registrations` in *Http*, a
single object of a new registration. **Hàpi** enjoys this offering, and will let you
know that your prayer has been granted, but refuses to return any more to you than
what you supplied to begin with.
